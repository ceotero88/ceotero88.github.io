                <h3>Pokémon Stat Explorer</h3>
                <p>
                    The Pokémon Stat Explorer is an interactive Shiny app designed to visualize Pokémon attributes across generations and types. This application allows users to explore the relationships between a Pokémon's Attack and Defense stats, filtered by type and generation. Users can examine specific generations or compare all generations simultaneously, providing flexibility in analysis. The app further enhances insights by distinguishing between Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokémon, enabling users to understand how these rare Pokémon compare to others. The primary goal of the app is to offer an intuitive and dynamic interface for exploring patterns in Pokémon data. By toggling between different types, generations, and views, users can uncover deeper insights into how Pokémon characteristics have evolved across the franchise’s history.

                <h3>Patient No-Show Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    The Patient No-Show Analysis is a visualization interface designed to help healthcare providers understand factors influencing patient no-shows to appointments. Through interactive visualizations, this app allows providers to explore demographic trends and health-related factors associated with higher no-show rates, enabling data-driven strategies for targeted interventions. Key visualization approaches include a bar chart comparing no-show rates across health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, a line plot revealing trends in no-show rates by month to identify seasonal patterns, and an interactive line plot showing how age and gender distributions relate to no-show rates. This application empowers healthcare providers with actionable insights to optimize appointment scheduling, resource allocation, and patient engagement strategies.
