                This research paper investigates customer satisfaction for electronics sold on Amazon, leveraging sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to uncover consumer behavior patterns. Using the 2020 Amazon Product Reviews Dataset, the analysis identifies common complaints and compliments, evaluates time-based trends, and examines differences between purchases on Amazon and brand-specific stores. The study also highlights the importance of review length and sentiment, revealing how short reviews often capture concise feedback while longer reviews provide deeper insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conducted using Python on Google Colab, this project utilized libraries like NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment scoring and data visualization tools to identify trends. The findings offer actionable recommendations for manufacturers and retailers, such as improving product features based on customer feedback and refining marketing strategies to emphasize highly-rated attributes. Overall, the paper underscores the value of sentiment analysis in understanding consumer preferences and enhancing the e-commerce experience.

            A Tableau project visualizing global COVID-19 data with interactive maps and time zone insights.

            <p>
                This project used Tableau to create a dynamic world map that visualizes COVID-19 cases and trends by country and time zone. The dashboard includes features like hover-over tooltips displaying metrics (total cases, location, and time zone), circle sizes representing total cases, and color coding by time zone. A dropdown filter allows users to focus on specific time zones, providing a tailored view of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key insights include identifying time zones dominated by countries with high populations, such as the USA, China, and India, which naturally drive total case counts. The diversity of countries in UTC+1 highlights differences in case trends driven by public policy, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic factors. This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Tableau’s geographic and interactivity features to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in global datasets.

                <h3>Arduino Sound Sensor LED Control</h3>
                <p>
                    A circuit designed to change an LED's color based on sound levels using an Arduino, sound sensor, and RGB LED.
                    <button class="toggle-details" onclick="toggleDetails('arduino')">Read More</button>

                    <p>
                        This project involved designing and building a circuit using an Arduino Uno to control the color of an RGB LED based on sound levels picked up by a sound sensor. The setup included a breadboard for organizing connections, jumper cables to link components, resistors to protect the circuit, and an RGB LED that changed colors depending on the input from the sensor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sound sensor captured ambient noise levels and sent voltage signals to the Arduino. I programmed the Arduino in C++ using the Arduino IDE, mapping the sensor’s analog input to RGB color values. Functions like analogRead() gathered the sound data, while analogWrite() adjusted the red, green, and blue pins on the LED, making it respond dynamically to sound in real-time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the circuit worked smoothly, I added resistors to prevent damage to the LED and made sure all jumper connections were solid. The final project combined hardware and software to create a responsive system that translated sound into light, offering hands-on experience with signal processing and embedded systems.
